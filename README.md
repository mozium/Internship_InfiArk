The repository is dedicated to the group project done during the internship, co-supervised by InfiArk Technology and Industrial Technology Research Institute. The project aimed at generating supportive information for management, constructing prediction models with electricity consumption data. The highlight was its choice of data source. Traditionally, to supervise production activities, the data has to be collected with the help of those that are to be supervised, or outsourced with significant expenses. In contrast, by drawing information from the electricity provider, the process became not only cost-effective, but also substantially more resilient to risk of fraudulent behaviors. Furthermore, due to common interests shared with the provider, the dataâ€™s integrity was perpetuated.
